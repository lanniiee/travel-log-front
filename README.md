<b>Travel Guide</b>
<br/>
<i>Intro:</i>
<br/>
This is a fullstack project that was completed within a week. 
The webpage fetches API which contains information on the following:
- Id for each reviews
- Name of the reviewer
- Location
- Image of Location
- Cost of Travel
- Places to Visit
- Date travelled from and to
- Date created on

<i>Features</i>
<br/>
Home page destination changes everytime the page load. 
This webpage allows users to read other people's reviews on their travel and upload their own reviews. 
Users are given the choice to update reviews, and to be able to delete reviews when entering the correct pin.
When user is on the destinations page, they can see all the reviews. Once they click on a review, it will take them to a page with more information about that reviews, which includes comments. This also gives the user the ability to be able to update or delete the review. 
As mentioned above, the user can only delete the review if they enter the correct pin. 
The update button will navigate the user to the update page.  

<i>Front-end:</i>
<br/>
This project's front-end was built by using Javascript, SASS, HTML, and React. 
React (flexible JS library) was used in this project to ensure that the user can render the page depending on what is being clicked. It also allows the Nav to stay on every page and have components that can be reuseable. React is also used for any functionality suchas if statements and fetching API. 
SASS is used to style the page accordingly with variables for font and color being reused so that any future changes can be implemented efficiently and effectively.

<i>Back-end:</i>
<br/>
This project's back-end was built using Java, SpringBoot and SQL.
The API that is being fetched in the front-end is built using all mentioned above.
